The dataset includes 2027 images.
Lamp are annotated in YOLO26 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the bounding box
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
